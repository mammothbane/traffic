Nathan's Traffic Solver
==============================

This implementation runs on Python 3. It was written for 3.5.2, but any version 3.x should also work. There are no
external dependencies.

To solve a specific problem, use main.py:

    python main.py FILE STRATEGY

where FILE is a JSON-formatted specification file and STRATEGY is one of BFS, DFS, IDS, ASTAR. To run all of the
examples (including my 'simple' 4x4 one), test_{strategy}.py files are provided.

The problem specification files follow a straightforward format, and examples are provided. 1 through 3 are the
problems specified in the project pdf, in order.
