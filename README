Nathan's Traffic Solver
==============================

This implementation runs on Python 3. It was written for 3.5.2, but any version 3.x should also work. There are no
external dependencies.

To solve a specific problem, use main.py:

    python main.py FILE STRATEGY [--heuristic HEURISTIC].

where FILE is a JSON-formatted specification file, STRATEGY is one of BFS, DFS, IDS, and ASTAR, and HEURISTIC is a valid
heuristic (listed under the traffic.heuristic package). To run all reasonable (read: terminating) examples (including
my 'simple' 4x4 one), test_{strategy}.py files are provided.

The problem specification files follow a straightforward format, and examples are provided. 1 through 3 are the
problems specified in the project pdf, in order.

To run each of the numbered examples with bfs, for example, one could run:

    python main.py examples/{1, 2, 3}.json BFS
